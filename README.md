# NumberConverser_Java

In the process of development Java, Eclipse IDE and Swing library were used.

This is one of my Java projects. Main function of it is conversing numbers from one system to another (for example, from 10x to 2x). 
Application uses GUI based on Swing library. 
ATTENTION: in created JAR-file package was changed from "calculator" to "converter".

In order to run application you have to download Number Converter.jar and start it (at least JRE is needed).
